### 2. The Lambertian reflectance model:

a. Considers each surface element as a square area that emits light

b. Implies that the position of the light source is not relevant

c. Implies that the perceived light intensity depends on the surface normal

### 3. Aperture problem

### 4. Closing in morphology is performed

a. By first dilating and then eroding

b. To compensate for illumination changes

c. To remove small and non-relevant areas after background subtraction

### 5. Gaussian average may be used for background subtraction but:

a. The algorithm suffers the presence of multiple moving objects

b. The algorithm does not handle multi-modal backgrounds

c. The algorithm isn't fast enough in updating the background model
