### 1. Please discuss the principles of Kalman tracking

### 3. Optical flow: what does it rapresent and how is it computed? Please also illustrate the issues related to optical flow

### 4. In feature evaluation the integral image is useful because:

a. It can be computed in one pass for every point

b. It considers all color components

c. It highlights salient details of objects

### 5. In the Gaussian Mixture model:

a. The variance of the Gaussians is fixed

b. The mean value of the Gaussians is fixed

c. The number of Gaussians is fixed

### 6. In stereo matching the parallax problem:

a. Cannot be avoided

b. Can be removed if the matching points are carefully selected

c. None of the above

### 7. The "Good Features To Track" algorithm:

a. Can consider as a good candidate a pixel with a costant sorrounding

b. Evaluates the feature value in a pixel location by checking the 8-connected pixels

c. Might show different performances depending on the level of blurring
