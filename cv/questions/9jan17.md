### 1. What is planar homography?

### 2. While computing correspondences in stereo matching

a. Correlation is computed considering the histogram of the entire image

b. Correlation is computed considering the single pixel information

c. Correlation is computed using a block of pre-defined size

### 3. According to the SIFT algorithm an octave is:

a. A set of images of the same resolution processed with different Gaussian filtering

b. A set of images processed with the same Gaussian filtering but at different spatial resolutions

c. Is the co-presence of multiple feature points at different spatial resolutions

### 4. The camera matrix
a. Represents only the intrinsic parameters of the camera

b. Represents both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters

c. Does not change in case the camera is moved

### 5. In the pyramidal implementation of the LK optical flow, the information is propagated to the next layers according to:
a. g^(L-1) = 2(g^L + d^L)
b. g^(L-1) = 2g^L + d^L
C. g^(L-1) = 2(g^L + 2d^L)
