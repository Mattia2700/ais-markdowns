### 2. Describe the process of extraction of SIFT features

### 3. Explain in detail the how a particle filter operates, highlighting the benefits of such an approach compared to other tracking algorithms.

### 4. While computing the correspondences in stereo processing the first thing we compute is

a. The Z coordinate

b. The X and Y coordinates of the matching point

c. The correlation between the two images

### 5. The fundamental matrix:

a. Depends on the intrinsic parameters

b. Is used to map the point in the world with the point in the camera view.

c. Is used to map a point in the real world on two images planes

### 6. In color representation: 

a. The HUE component of HSV contains the luminance information

b. The Y component of YUV contains the yellow color information

c. The V component of HSV contains the brightness information
