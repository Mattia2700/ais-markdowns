### 2. Optical flow

### 3. Please describe how the depth coordinate of a point is computed in a stereo configuration where the cameras are parallel and aligned, starting from the two acquired pictures (find correspondences and matching)

### 6. Gaussian average may be used for background subtraction but:

a. The algorithm suffers the presence of multiple moving objects

b. The algorithm does not handle multi-modal backgrounds

c. The algorithm isnâ€™t fast enough in updating the background model
