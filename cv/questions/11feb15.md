### 2. Please explain the role of the learning rate in background subtraction

### 3. Particle filtering. Please describe in detail the principles of the filter for tracking applications

### 4. The algorithm “Good Features To Track” aims at finding

a. local features invariant to scale

b. local features invariant to rotation

c. salient points like edges and high curvature points

### 5. Motion detection obeys to the optical flow equation. This means that

a. Objects with a pure translational motion model cannot be detected

b. Moving pixels belonging to uniform region are not detected

c. Only in the case motion occurs along the surface tangent, motion can be detected

### 6. In the Kalman filter model

a. The measurement and process noise are correlated

b. The measurement noise depends on the characteristics of objects motion

c. At every frame a new prediction is created
