## What is the resolving power of a camera?

The resolving power of a camera, or in particular a its lens, is the ability to distinguish between two lines or points that are close together. It is measured in lines per millimeter (lines/mm). The greater the resolving power, the smaller the minimum distance between two points/lines that can be distinguished otherwise they will appear as one object (blurry). The larger the N.A. (numerical aperture) of the lens, the greater the resolving power.

$R_p = \frac{1}{2\Delta}$, with $2\Delta = f\cdot\sin(\theta)$ or $f\theta$ when $\theta$ is very small.

## Please describe how the depth coordinate of a point is computed in a stereo configuration where the cameras are parallel and aligned
