# 4. Fundamental matrix

The fundamental matrix:

c. Is used to map a point in the real world on two image planes

The reason is that the fundamental matrix is a 3-by-3 matrix that relates corresponding points in stereo images¹²³. It describes the geometric constraints between two cameras that view the same 3-D scene from different positions¹²³. It can be used to find the epipolar lines, the epipoles, and the epipolar geometry of the stereo pair¹²³.

The fundamental matrix does not depend on the intrinsic parameters of the cameras, such as the focal length, the principal point, or the distortion coefficients¹²³. It only depends on the relative pose and orientation of the cameras, which are described by the essential matrix¹²³. The fundamental matrix can be computed from the essential matrix by multiplying it with the inverse of the camera matrices¹²³.

The fundamental matrix is also not used to map a point in the world with a point in the camera view, because it does not involve any 3-D coordinates or projections¹²³. It only operates on 2-D image coordinates, which are homogeneous vectors in a projective space¹²³. The fundamental matrix can be used to find the corresponding point in one image given a point in another image, but it cannot recover the depth or location of the point in the world¹²³. (**not sure**)
