# 2. Lambertian reflectance model

The answer is **(c) Implies that the perceived light intensity depends on the surface normal**.

The Lambertian reflectance model is a model of diffuse reflection. Diffuse reflection is the reflection of light in all directions from a surface. The Lambertian reflectance model assumes that the perceived light intensity depends only on the angle between the surface normal and the direction of the incident light.

The Lambertian reflectance model does not consider each surface element as a square area that emits light. This is because diffuse reflection does not involve emission of light from the surface. The Lambertian reflectance model also does not imply that the position of the light source is not relevant. The position of the light source does affect the perceived light intensity, but it does so in a way that is consistent with the Lambertian reflectance model.

So the correct answer is (c).

Here are some additional details about the Lambertian reflectance model:

* The Lambertian reflectance model is a simple model that is often used in computer graphics.
* The Lambertian reflectance model is a good approximation for many real-world surfaces, such as matte paint.
* The Lambertian reflectance model does not take into account the specular reflection that occurs from some surfaces.

The Lambertian reflectance model is a useful tool for understanding how light interacts with surfaces. It is also a useful model for computer graphics, where it can be used to render realistic images of objects.

# 4. Closing in morphology

The answer is **(a) By first dilating and then eroding**.

Closing in morphology is a mathematical operation that is performed on binary images. It is a combination of dilation and erosion. Dilation expands the boundaries of objects in an image, while erosion shrinks the boundaries of objects. Closing first dilates an image and then erodes the dilated image. This helps to remove small holes in objects and to connect small objects that are close together.

Closing is often used to remove small and non-relevant areas after background subtraction. Background subtraction is a technique that is used to remove the background from an image. This can be done by subtracting a background image from the current image. However, background subtraction can sometimes leave small holes or gaps in the foreground. Closing can be used to fill in these holes and gaps.

So the correct answer is (a).

Here are some additional details about closing in morphology:

* Closing is a morphological operation that is often used in image processing and computer vision.
* Closing can be used to remove small holes in objects, to connect small objects that are close together, and to fill in gaps in the foreground.
* Closing is often used after background subtraction to remove small and non-relevant areas.

# 5. Gaussian average

The correct answer is b. The algorithm does not handle multi-modal backgrounds. This is because Gaussian average assumes that each pixel has a single Gaussian distribution, which is not true for backgrounds that have multiple modes or variations, such as waving trees, water surfaces, or shadows. Option a and c are incorrect because Gaussian average can handle multiple moving objects, and it is fast enough in updating the background model.
