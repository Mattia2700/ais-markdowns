# 5. Camera calibration

The correct answer is B. The distance of the object from the camera is measured123. This is because camera calibration is the process of estimating the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera model, which relate the 3D coordinates of an object in the world to its 2D projection on the image plane123. The focal length is an intrinsic parameter that determines the magnification of the image, and it is relevant for camera calibration12. The properties of the CCD (charge-coupled device) are also intrinsic parameters that affect the image quality, such as pixel size, aspect ratio, skew, and distortion12. Therefore, options A and C are incorrect.

Yes, the focal length is relevant in camera calibration123. The focal length is the distance between the camera center and the image plane, and it determines how much the scene is magnified by the lens123. The focal length is an intrinsic parameter of the camera model, which means that it does not depend on the position or orientation of the camera in the 3D scene123. The focal length can be used to create a camera matrix, which can be used to remove distortion due to the lenses of a specific camera1. The camera matrix is unique to a specific camera, so once calculated, it can be reused on other images taken by the same camera1.

Yes, the distance of the object from the camera is measured in camera calibration123. The distance of the object from the camera is related to the extrinsic parameters of the camera model, which represent the location and orientation of the camera in the 3D scene23. The extrinsic parameters can be estimated by using images that contain a calibration pattern, such as a checkerboard or a circle grid23. The calibration pattern provides a set of 3D points whose coordinates are known in a world coordinate system, and their corresponding 2D projections on the image plane23. By using multiple images of the calibration pattern taken from different viewpoints, the extrinsic parameters can be solved by using a geometric method or an optimization method23. The distance of the object from the camera can then be calculated by using the extrinsic parameters and the camera matrix1.

No, the properties of the CCD are not implicitly considered in the camera matrix in camera calibration123. The properties of the CCD (charge-coupled device) are the physical characteristics of the image sensor, such as pixel size, aspect ratio, skew, and distortion123. These properties affect the image quality and the mapping between the world coordinates and the image coordinates123. The camera matrix is a 3x3 matrix that contains the focal length and the optical center of the camera, which are also intrinsic parameters of the camera model123. However, the camera matrix does not account for the CCD properties, which are usually modeled by a distortion vector that contains five or more coefficients123. The distortion vector is estimated separately from the camera matrix in camera calibration, and it is used to correct for lens distortion in the images123. Therefore, the properties of the CCD are not implicitly considered in the camera matrix, but they are explicitly considered in the distortion vector.

# 6. Good features to track approach

The correct answer is C. salient points like edges and high curvature points12. This is because the Good Features To Track algorithm is based on the idea that a good feature is a corner that has a large eigenvalue in both directions12. This means that the feature has a high intensity gradient in both horizontal and vertical directions, which makes it easy to track12. The algorithm does not aim at finding features that are invariant to scale or rotation, as these are properties of the feature descriptor, not the feature detector.
