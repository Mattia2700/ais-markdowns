# 3. Stereo camera

The depth coordinate of a point in a stereo configuration where the cameras are parallel and aligned is computed by estimating the **disparity** between the left and right images of the point. The disparity is the difference in horizontal coordinates of the point in the two images. The depth coordinate is inversely proportional to the disparity, meaning that points that are closer to the camera have larger disparities and points that are farther have smaller disparities. The depth coordinate can be calculated using the formula:

$$
Z = \frac{fB}{d}
$$

where Z is the depth coordinate, f is the focal length of the cameras, B is the baseline distance between the cameras, and d is the disparity¹²³.

# 4. Optical Flow and motion detection

Optical flow is the motion of objects between consecutive frames of a sequence, caused by the relative movement between the object and camera1. Optical flow methods can be used for fluid mechanics applications, such as measuring velocity fields or detecting vortices2.

One challenge of optical flow estimation is the aperture problem, which occurs when the motion of a one-dimensional feature, such as an edge, is ambiguous because only the component of the motion perpendicular to the edge can be measured3. The other component, parallel to the edge, cannot be determined from the local image information alone3.

Orthogonal and parallel are terms that describe the relationship between two vectors or lines. Two vectors or lines are orthogonal if they are perpendicular to each other, meaning they form a 90-degree angle. Two vectors or lines are parallel if they have the same direction or slope, meaning they never intersect.

# 5. Kalman filter

The correct answer is C. At every frame a new prediction is created12. This is because the Kalman filter is an iterative algorithm that updates the state estimate and the error covariance matrix based on the previous estimates and the new measurements13. The prediction step of the Kalman filter uses the system model and the control inputs to project the state estimate and the error covariance matrix forward in time14. Therefore, at every frame, a new prediction is created based on the latest information available.
