# 2. Region based tracking

The answer is **b. is estimated using the appearance model**.

Region-based racking is a method for tracking moving objects in a video sequence. It works by first dividing the image into a grid of regions. Then, for each region, an appearance model is learned. This model describes the statistical distribution of the pixels in the region.

To estimate the next position of the moving object, the appearance models of the neighboring regions are used. The object is assumed to move to the region with the highest probability of containing it.

The contour information of the object is not used in region-based racking. This is because the contour information can be easily affected by noise and occlusions. The appearance model, on the other hand, is more robust to these challenges.

So, the next position of the moving object in region-based racking is estimated using the appearance model of the neighboring regions. Option (a), which is the contour information, is not used. Option (c), which is computing the trajectory, is also not used.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

# 4. Histograms

The correct answer is **b. Estimate the location of a known object in a scene**. A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of pixel values in an image. It can be used to analyze the shape, appearance, and contrast of an object by looking at the peaks and valleys of the histogram¹²³. For example, a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor that counts the occurrences of gradient orientations in an image. It can be used to estimate the location of a known object by comparing its HOG with a template HOG²³. A histogram can also be used to perform thresholding, which is a technique to separate an object from the background by choosing a pixel value that divides the histogram into two regions¹⁴.

Histograms cannot be used to **understand the shape of a known object** (a) because they do not capture the spatial information of the pixels, only their values. Histograms also cannot be used to **evaluate the quality of a background subtraction algorithm** (c) because they do not measure how well the algorithm separates the foreground from the background, only how the pixel values are distributed.

# 5. Background subtraction

The correct answer is **a. The learning rate models how fast the background is updated**. The learning rate is a parameter that controls how much the current frame affects the background model. A higher learning rate means that the background model adapts faster to changes in the scene, while a lower learning rate means that the background model is more stable and resistant to noise¹⁴.

The statement **b. Using a Gaussian average, one distribution is used for every frame** is false because using a Gaussian average means that one distribution is used for every pixel, not every frame. A Gaussian average is a simple way to model the background by assuming that each pixel follows a normal distribution with a mean and a standard deviation⁴.

The statement **c. Multiple Gaussians are used in presence of multiple moving objects** is also false because multiple Gaussians are used to model the background, not the foreground. Multiple Gaussians are used to handle situations where the background is not static, such as waving trees, water surfaces, or shadows. Each pixel is modeled by a mixture of Gaussians, and the weights of the Gaussians are updated based on how well they fit the pixel values⁴.
