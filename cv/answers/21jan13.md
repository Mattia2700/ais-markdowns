# 2. Lambertian illumination model

The Lambertian illumination mode is based on the assumption that the surface being illuminated is an **ideal diffuse reflector**¹, which means that it reflects light equally in all directions and does not depend on the viewing angle². The amount of light reflected by a Lambertian surface is proportional to the **cosine** of the angle between the light source and the surface normal². This mode is useful for modeling surfaces that are rough or matte, such as paper, cloth, or wood³.

# 3. Stereo depth correspondences/correlation

The matching is computed by comparing the **similarity** of small patches of pixels in the left and right images of the stereo rig³. The similarity can be measured by different methods, such as **sum of squared differences**, **sum of absolute differences**, or **normalized cross-correlation**³. The matching process tries to find the best match for each patch in the left image by searching along the corresponding **epipolar line** in the right image, and vice versa³. The difference in horizontal positions of the matched patches is called the **disparity**, which is inversely proportional to the **depth** of the scene point³.

The correlation is the method of measuring the similarity between the patches of pixels. For example, the normalized cross-correlation is defined as the dot product of the normalized patches, which ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 means perfect correlation and -1 means perfect anti-correlation. The higher the correlation, the more likely the patches are matched.

# 4. Aperture problem

The correct answer is **a**. The aperture problem refers to the incapability of determining the motion component **parallel** to the edge¹²³. This is because when a contoured stimulus is moving behind an aperture, only a part of it is visible, and the motion detector can only measure the movement in the direction **perpendicular** to the edge orientation²³. The motion component parallel to the edge is **ambiguous** and depends on the global shape and motion of the stimulus⁴⁵. Therefore, b is incorrect and c is also incorrect.

# 5. Gaussian Mixture Model

The correct answer is **b**. In the Gaussian Mixture Model, a number of Gaussian is used for each pixel¹²³. This is because each pixel can belong to different subpopulations or clusters, and the Gaussian Mixture Model can represent the probability distribution of each pixel by a weighted sum of Gaussian components²³. The weights are determined by the **expectation-maximization** algorithm, which iteratively updates the parameters of the model to maximize the likelihood of the data²³. Therefore, a is incorrect and c is also incorrect.

# Extrinsic parameters

The correct answer is **a**. Extrinsic parameters refer to the position and orientation of the camera with respect to the real world coordinates¹². They consist of a rotation and a translation matrix that transform the world points to the camera coordinates¹². The extrinsic parameters are different for each camera and depend on the location of the camera in the 3-D scene¹. Therefore, b is incorrect and c is also incorrect.
