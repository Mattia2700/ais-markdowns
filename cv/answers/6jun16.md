# 3. Stereo matching (parallel and aligned cameras)

Sure. Here is how the depth coordinate of a point is computed in a stereo configuration where the cameras are parallel and aligned, starting from the two acquired pictures:

1. Find correspondences between the two images. This means finding pairs of pixels in the two images that correspond to the same point in the real world. There are many different ways to do this, such as using feature matching algorithms.
2. Once the correspondences have been found, the disparity between the two images can be computed. The disparity is the difference in the pixel coordinates of the corresponding points in the two images.
3. The depth coordinate of the point can then be computed using the following formula:

```
depth = f * disparity / B (wrong)
```

where:

* f is the focal length of the camera
* B is the baseline distance between the two cameras

The focal length and baseline distance can be determined during the camera calibration process.

The process of finding correspondences and computing disparity is known as stereo matching. It is a challenging problem, but there are many different algorithms that can be used. The choice of algorithm depends on the quality of the images, the complexity of the scene, and the desired accuracy of the depth estimation.

# 6. Gaussian average

The answer is **(a) and (b)**. Gaussian average is a simple background subtraction algorithm that works by computing the mean of the pixel values in each frame. The pixels that are significantly different from the mean are then classified as foreground objects.

However, Gaussian average has two main drawbacks:

* It suffers from the presence of multiple moving objects. This is because the mean of the pixel values will be constantly changing as the objects move around. This can make it difficult to distinguish between the foreground objects and the background objects.
* It does not handle multi-modal backgrounds. A multi-modal background is a background that contains multiple different types of objects. For example, a background that contains both trees and buildings is a multi-modal background. Gaussian average can have difficulty distinguishing between the different types of objects in a multi-modal background.

The speed of the algorithm is not a major drawback of Gaussian average. It is a relatively fast algorithm, and it can be used in real-time applications.

So the correct answer is option (a) and (b). Option (c) is not a drawback of Gaussian average.
