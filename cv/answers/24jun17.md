# 1. Kalman tracking

Kalman tracking is a method of estimating the state of a system, such as the position and velocity of an object, based on noisy and incomplete measurements³⁵. It consists of two steps: prediction and update³⁵. In the prediction step, the Kalman filter uses a state transition model to predict the future state of the system and its uncertainty³⁵. In the update step, the Kalman filter uses a measurement model to incorporate new observations and correct the predicted state and its uncertainty³⁵. The Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with Gaussian noise³⁵, but it can also be extended to nonlinear systems or non-Gaussian noise with some modifications³⁵.

# 3. Optical flow

Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene¹²³. It can be represented as a 2D vector field where each vector is a displacement vector showing the movement of points from one frame to another²³. Optical flow can be computed using various methods, such as gradient-based methods, phase-based methods, feature-based methods, or deep learning methods¹²³. Some of the issues related to optical flow are:

- The aperture problem: The inability to determine the true motion direction of an edge when only a small portion of it is visible¹².
- The correspondence problem: The difficulty of finding matching points between two frames that correspond to the same physical point¹².
- The occlusion problem: The situation where some points in one frame are not visible in another frame due to occlusion by other objects¹².
- The noise problem: The presence of noise or artifacts in the images that can affect the accuracy of optical flow estimation¹².

# 4. Integral image

The correct answer is **a**. In feature evaluation, the integral image is useful because it can be computed in one pass for every point²³. An integral image is a new image representation that allows for very fast feature evaluation by storing the sum of all pixels above and to the left of a given pixel²³. This way, any subregion summation can be computed in constant time as a linear combination of only four pixels in the integral image, regardless of the size of the subregion²³. Therefore, b is incorrect and c is also incorrect.

# 5. Gaussian Mixture Model

The correct answer is **c**. In the Gaussian Mixture model, the number of Gaussians is fixed¹²³. A Gaussian Mixture model is a probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population³. It consists of a weighted sum of K Gaussian components, where K is the number of Gaussians¹²³. The parameters of each Gaussian component, such as the mean and the variance, are estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm¹²³. Therefore, a is incorrect and b is also incorrect.

# 6. Parallax problem

The correct answer is **c**. None of the above. In stereo matching, the parallax problem is not a problem, but a phenomenon that allows to estimate the depth of a scene from two or more images taken from different viewpoints¹²³. Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object due to a change in the observer's position¹²³. Stereo matching is the process of finding corresponding points in two or more images that correspond to the same physical point in the scene¹²³. The parallax of each point can be used to compute its disparity, which is inversely proportional to its depth¹²³. Therefore, a is incorrect and b is also incorrect. **(not sure)**

The correct answer is **b**. In stereo matching, the parallax problem can be removed if the matching points are carefully selected¹². The parallax problem refers to the situation where the disparity of a point changes depending on the location of the matching point¹². This is because the disparity is inversely proportional to the depth of the scene point¹². Therefore, if the matching point is not on the same surface as the scene point, the disparity will be different¹². This problem can be avoided by selecting matching points that are on the same surface as the scene point¹². Therefore, a is incorrect and c is also incorrect.

# 7. Good Features To Track

The correct answer is **c**. The "Good Features To Track" algorithm might show different performances depending on the level of blurring¹². This is because the algorithm evaluates the feature value in a pixel location by checking the eigenvalues of the second-moment matrix¹², which measures the change in intensity around that pixel¹⁰. If the image is blurred, the intensity changes will be less pronounced and the algorithm will have a harder time finding good features to track¹⁰. Therefore, a is incorrect and b is also incorrect.
