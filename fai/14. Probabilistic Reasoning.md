# Enumeration-Ask

Given a query variable, observed evidence and a Bayesian network, returns the probability distribution of the query variable given the evidence.

For each value of the query variable compute the $P(x_i, Y, e)$ and normalize the result.

# Elimination-Ask

Given a query variable, observed evidence and a Bayesian network, returns the probability distribution of the query variable.

For each variable in the network, ordered, factors are computed and preppended to a list of already computed factors. If that variable is an hidden variable, the factors are summed out. At the end, the pointwise product of all the factors is normalized and returned.
