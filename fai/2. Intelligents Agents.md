# Table-Driven-Agent

Given a percept returns an action, making use of a table of possible actions: after adding the last percept to the percepts sequence, a lookup is operated on the table to get determine the right action.

# Reflex-Vacuum-Agent

Given a location and a status returns the action to be performed. 

If the current status is dirty, the agent will clean (suck) the location, otherwise it will move to the next location (left or right).

# Simple-Reflex-Agent

Given a percept returns an action, making use of a table of rules to determine the action to be performed.

The current state is computed from the percept and used to find the right rule in the table: the action associated with the rule is returned.

# Model-Based-Reflex-Agent

Given a percept returns an action, making use of an internal state kept by the agent, a model describing how the next state depends on the current state and action, a table of rules and the most recent action.

The current state is updated from the percept using the model and previous state and action, then the updated state is used to match the rule in the table and the  associated action is returned.
