# Graphplan

Given a problem, returns a solution or failure.

After computing the initial planning graph and the goals, checks if all the goals are all non-mutex, and in that case extract the solution from the planning graph and return it if it is not a failure; if the graph and the number of state not good have both leveled off, return failure, otherwise expand the graph and repeat the process until a solution is found or failure is returned.

# SATplan

Given a problem and a maximum number of steps, returns a solution or failure.

The problem is converted to a CNF formula using a plan length of 0, and a SAT solver is called on it: if the model is not empty, the solution is extracted and returned. This process is repeated increasing the plan length until the maximum number of steps is reached or a solution is found. If no solution is found, failure is returned.
