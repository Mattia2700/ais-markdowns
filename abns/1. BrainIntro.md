# Cortex

- Temporal lobe, on the sides of the brain, is responsible for hearing and language.
- Parietal lobe, on the top-back of the brain, is responsible for attention, touch and saccade planning.
- Frontal lobe, on the front of the brain, is responsible for planning, execution, higher level cognition, high level language processing and language production.
- Occipital lobe, on the back of the brain, is responsible for vision.

# Other structures

- Cerebellum, at the back of the brain, is responsible for fine motor control.
- Thalamus, in the middle of the brain, is the major sensory gateway to the cortex.
- Hippocampus, in the middle of the brain, is responsible for memory.
- Corpus Callosum, in the middle of the brain, is responsible for communication between the two hemispheres, composed of white matter.

# Matter

## Grey matter

It is defined gray becuase of its color, caused by the high density of cell bodies with few myelinated axons. The areas where grey matter is found are sensory processing and cognition related, but can be found in other areas of the brain (cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, etc).

## White matter

It consists mainly of long range axons that connect different areas of the brain, responsible for efficient communication. Its structure can change with learning because new better connections can be formed.

# Neurons

The human brain can be studied at different levels of scale, from systems and pathways to circuits and neurons up to synapses and membranes.

Connections between neurons are called synapses and occur on neuron dendrites, which receives chimical synaptial signals from other neurons. A neuron will 'fire' when the sum of all the signals it receives is above a certain threshold. The neuron will then send a signal down its axon to other neurons.

When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, it open calcium channels, responsible for releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters will then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, generating a postsynaptic potential, that can either be excitatory or inhibitory.
